# Richtig oder Faust

This guessing game comes with a twist! You are asked questions about random facts like "How heavy is the sun?" and whose estimate is further from the truth will be hit! Only virtually of course.

You can play against an NPC or your friends, in order to flex your general education ;)

The game is currently only available in German, english implementation will be added.
It is also available on the Playstore: "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SvRoDevelopments.QuizBrawl&hl=en&gl=US"
